# Global To Do
- [ ] Change the path variable so that someone else can easily adapt it (for ForceEPS output).

# Description
Summary of work done during the first year of the PhD, including literature review, preliminary analyses, and initial modeling work.

# Literature Review

# Preliminary Work

## Retz Analyses
- In `Import_data.R`:
  - Created two data tables:
    - `data/retz/forest_data` — contains all Retz data.
    - `data/forest_data` — filtered according to choices determined in `visualisation.Rmd` with ForceEPS species constraints.
- In `visualisation.Rmd`:
  - Visualized the Retz data.

## From Inventory to Model Initialization
- Work in progress: need to explain and clean the code.

## Repetition
- `Generate.R`: generate the necessary repetition data for ForceEPS.
- `Import_output.R`: create outputs:
  - `output/repetition_mean.RData`
  - `output/repetition_productivityScene.RData`

## Param_Type
- Results are okay.
- Would like to improve:
  - `Create_unif_inv.R`
  - `Generate.R`
  - `Import_output.R`  
  by using `utils` and rewriting the code more cleanly.

# Study Beginning
Potential introduction for a Master internship:  
- `Generate.R`: generate ForceEPS initialization files.  
- `Run_forceeps.R`: run ForceEPS in parallel with the generated init files.  
- `Post_processing.R`: import and modify data to relink each simulation to each itinerary and create different scenarios (combinations of itineraries).  

> A lot of writing still needed to explain the questions and what was done.

# Reusable code (maybe for forceeps analyses)
- `utils.R` — mainly for inventory and output functions.
- SEE : `R/utils/inventory_utils.R` & `R/utils/output_utils.R`
